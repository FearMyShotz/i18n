# 🌐 i18n Translation Files

This repository hosts the translation files (JSON format) used by the [gge-tracker.com](https://gge-tracker.com).

The goal is to provide an easy and open way for contributors to help improve or add translations.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Edit** the language file you want to improve (`fr.json`, `en.json`, etc.) or **add a new one** (e.g., `es.json` for Spanish).
3. **Submit a Pull Request** with your changes.

We will review and merge valid contributions regularly. The updated translations will be automatically published via GitHub Pages and used in the app.

## 📝 Guidelines

- Keep the JSON syntax valid — use a JSON linter or formatter if needed.
- Try to follow the tone and style used in other translations.
- Do not rename existing keys unless absolutely necessary.
